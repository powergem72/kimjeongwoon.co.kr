        <h2>Brain network modeling</h2>
        <p>Brain is a complex network system that people can't understand fully and making network model is still challenging.<br>
          The relation between voxels which are small part of brain like pixel cannot be determined because of effects from other voxels.<br>
          It means that this kind of connection may not be true because it does not reflect the effect of other areas<br>
          But due to number of voxels, it is hard to calculate connection with considering other voxel.<br>
          So If I do more research on it, then I will focus on how to reduce the number of voxel properly for making true connection between voxels</p>

        <h2>Evolution dynamics for Psychology</h2>
        <p>Also, we can't ignore the rate of people who have some paraphilia like pedophilia, because the percentage of it is estimated by 1 to 5 percent.<br>
             it is not small in medical science<br>
             But it is hard to explain this situation by evolutionary psychology.<br>
             Why these kind of mental illness survived today?<br>
            Likewise, If I choose my field as evolution dynamics, I will do research for the origin of these kind of phenomenon which is hard to explain by existing knowledges</p>

        <h2>Network modelling for Criminal</h2>
        <p>It is not easy to detect criminals. Some research even claims that the number of case for criminal is actully 10 times more than statstics announced by police<br>
            So it is important to make model for criminal considering concealment of it, because it can be used for setting effective policy to prevent criminals.<br>
            But many research focus on the psychological state and life history of perpetrators and social environment.<br>
            These are also important but they have limitation because they focus on group not individuals, which makes hard for us to predict the proability of criminals<br>
            Also collecting information of them is challenging<br>
            To overcome these limitation, I will do model the criminials action by network model considering the unobserved state if I decide these fields.
